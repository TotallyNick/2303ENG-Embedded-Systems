# 2303ENG Embedded Systems
This is my working drive of all of my labs, workshops and assignments that I have completed <br />
during the trimester 2 of 2025. The focus of this course is to learn how to design, implement and <br />
test embedded software on ARM architecture <br />

this is also my first time trying to make a decent looking github with good documentation <br />
