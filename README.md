# 2323ENG Embedded Systems
This is my working drive of all of my labs, workshops and assignments that I have completed
during the trimester 2 of 2025. The focus of this course is to learn how to design, implement and
test embedded software on ARM architecture

this is also my first time trying to make a decent looking github with good documentation
